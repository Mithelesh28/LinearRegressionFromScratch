# Linear Regression from Scratch

This project implements **Linear Regression as a simple Neural Network** using only NumPy.
No machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch were used.

## 📌 Objective
To understand the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of linear regression by building it from scratch.

## 📊 Dataset
Advertising dataset showing the relationship between **TV advertising spend** and **Sales**.

## 🧠 Model Overview
- Single neuron linear model
- Equation: ŷ = wX + b
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Optimization: Gradient Descent

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps
1. Data loading and visualization
2. Feature normalization
3. Forward propagation
4. Cost computation
5. Backpropagation
6. Parameter updates
7. Model training

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## 🚀 Why this project?
This project focuses on learning **how machine learning works internally**, rather than treating models as black boxes.

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Multivariate Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Comparison with scikit-learn implementation
